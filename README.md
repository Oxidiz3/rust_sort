# Overview
With this project I'm trying to get a further understanding of Rust as well as sorting algorithms and minute optimizations

## What is this code?
In my software I've written four different sorting algorithms and tested each one of them for speed and accuracy

## Purpose
I really enjoy writing optimized code and wanted to learn Rust to do so. I am really interested in the way that this 
language works and wanted to have some experience in it that I could use later.

## Presentation

# Development Environment
Pycharm with the Rust plugin
Rust and the Rust libraries rand and time

# Useful Websites
* [Rust Lang](http://rust-lang.org)
* [Geeks for Geeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org)

# Future Work
* Make the counting sort work with two-digit numbers
* Try and make the Tim sort more efficient
